# Redux boilerplate

A short and concise boilerplate tailored for my personal projects

## Installation

1. Make sure you have npm installed
2. 'npm install' will fetch the required dependencies

## Usage

This boilerplate comes with two configuration files for webpack, one for development, one for production. For more info, check out package.json. To start the development environment, run the 'dev' npm script. For the production version, with all the files available on the file system, run the 'prod' npm script.
